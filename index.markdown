### Procedual terrain generation
This project was a side project during some of the free time I had working in the summer of 2018. Following a series of [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbpMiKiSKm8&list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3), I created procedurally generated terrain in Unity, that creates a custom mesh, and implements multi-threading to generate meshes along the horizon of the camera to create endless terrain. The project is imperfect, and I am eager to revisit it and improve the shader used for coloring the terrain.
